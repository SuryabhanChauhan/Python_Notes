Some disadvantages od array based class(List):

1. The length of a dynamic array might be longer than the actual number of elements that it stores.
2. Amortized bounds for operations may be unacceptable in real-time systems.
3. Insertions and deletions at interior positions of an array are expensive.

So linked list is alternative to an array based sequence

**Singly Linked Lists**
A singly linked list, in its simplest form, is a collection of nodes that collectively form a linear sequence.
Each node stores a reference to an object that is an element of the sequence, as well as a reference to the next node of the list

linked list is that it does not have a predetermined fixed size; it uses space proportionally to its current number of elements.

The first and last node of a linked list are known as the head and tail of the list, respectively.

We can identify the tail as the node having None as its next reference.

the process of traversing a list is also known as link hopping or pointer hopping.

Minimally, the linked list instance must keep a reference to the head of the list. Without an explicit reference to the head, there
would be no way to locate that node (or indirectly, any others). There is not an absolute need to store a direct reference to the tail 
of the list, as it could otherwise be located by starting at the head and traversing the rest of the list. However, storing an explicit 
reference to the tail node is a common convenience to avoid such a traversal. In similar regard, it is common for the linked list 
instance to keep a count of the total number of nodes that comprise the list (commonly described as the size of the list), to avoid the
need to traverse the list to count the nodes.

*Inserting an Element at the Head of a Singly Linked List:

create a new node, set its element to the new element, set its next link to refer to the current head, and then set the list’s head to 
point to the new node.

pseudo code:

Algorithm add first(L,e):
newest = Node(e)      {create new node instance storing reference to element e}
newest.next = L.head  {set new node’s next to reference the old head node}
L.head = newest       {set variable head to reference the new node}
L.size = L.size+1     {increment the node count}

*Inserting an Element at the Tail of a Singly Linked List:

we create a new node, assign its next reference to None, set the next reference of the tail to point to this new node, and then update 
the tail reference itself to this new node.

but for above approch we should have pointer to out tail node otherwise we need to traverse the whole list in order to get the tail node

pseudo code:

Algorithm add last(L,e):
newest = Node(e)      {create new node instance storing reference to element e}
newest.next = None    {set new node’s next to reference the None object}
L.tail.next = newest  {make old tail node point to new node}
L.tail = newest       {set variable tail to reference the new node}
L.size = L.size+1     {increment the node count}

*Removing an Element from a Singly Linked List:

removing the head:

Algorithm remove first(L):
if L.head is None then
  Indicate an error: the list is empty.
L.head = L.head.next  {make head point to next node (or None)}
L.size = L.size−1     {decrement the node count}

removing the tail is difficult Even if we maintain a tail reference directly to the last node of the list, we must be able to access 
the node before the last node in order to remove the last node.and in order to do so we have to traverse the whole list which is time
consuming. to support this kind of operations more efficiently we will use doubly linked list

*Implementing a Stack with a Singly Linked List:
In designing such an implementation, we need to decide whether to model the top of the stack at the head or at the tail of the list.

Operation Running Time
S.push(e)    O(1)
S.pop()      O(1)
S.top()      O(1)
len(S)       O(1)
S.is empty() O(1)


*Implementing a Queue with a Singly Linked List


**Circularly Linked Lists**:
Even though a circularly linked list has no beginning or end, per se, we must maintain a reference to a particular node in order to make
use of the list. We use the identifier current to describe such a designated node. By setting current = current.next, we can effectively
advance through the nodes of the list.

*Round-Robin Schedulers:
using general linked queue ADT:
1. e = Q.dequeue()
2. Service element e
3. Q.enqueue(e)
so there are unnecessary enqueing and dequeuing happning here. One node is removed from the list, with appropriate adjustments to the 
head of the list and the size decremented, and then a new node is created to reinsert at the tail of the list and the size is 
incremented.
If using a circularly linked list, the effective transfer of an item from the “head” of the list to the “tail” of the list can be 
accomplished by advancing a reference that marks the boundary of the queue.
using circular queue:
1. Service element Q.front()
2. Q.rotate()


**Doubly Linked Lists**:

disadvantages with the singly linked list is that you can not delete an arbitrary node from an interior position of the list if only 
given a reference to that node, because we cannot determine the node that immediately precedes the node to be deleted (yet, that node 
needs to have its next reference updated).

so we define a new linked list where evry node point to its next as well as previous node, Such a structure is known as a doubly linked 
list. These lists allow a greater variety of O(1)-time update operations, including insertions and deletions at arbitrary positions
within the list.

In order to avoid some special cases when operating near the boundaries of a doubly linked list, it helps to add special nodes at both 
ends of the list: a header node at the beginning of the list, and a trailer node at the end of the list. These “dummy” nodes are known 
as sentinels (or guards), and they do not store elements of the primary sequence.

When using sentinel nodes, an empty list is initialized so that the next field of the header points to the trailer, and the prev field 
of the trailer points to the header.

*sentinels greatly simplifies the logic of our operations*
Most notably, the header and trailer nodes never change—only the nodes between them change.


Inserting and Deleting with a Doubly Linked List:

New element will be added between the header and the node that is currently after the header. nodes can be added in between also
To delete a node we will by pass that node by directly connecting the previous and next node.


Basic Implementation of a Doubly Linked List:
see the code Doubly_LL.py

Implementing a Deque with a Doubly Linked List:

With an array-based implementation, we achieve all operations in amortized O(1) time, due to the occasional need to resize the array. 
With an implementation based upon a doubly linked list, we can achieve all deque operation in worst-case O(1) time.
We implement LinkedDeque class that inherits from the DoublyLinkedBase class.
we do not implement explicit init, len, is_empty function as parent class is already having them.

**The Positional List ADT**:

An abstract data type that provides a user a way to refer to elements anywhere in a sequence, and to perform arbitrary insertions and 
deletions.
One of the great benefits of a linked list structure is that it is possible to perform O(1)-time insertions and deletions at arbitrary 
positions of the list, as long as we are given a reference to a relevant node of the list. It is therefore very tempting to
develop an ADT in which a node reference serves as the mechanism for describing a position.

However, such direct use of nodes would violate the object-oriented design principles of abstraction and encapsulation.There are several
reasons to prefer that we encapsulate the nodes of a linked list, for both our sake and for the benefit of users of our abstraction:

1. It will be simpler for users of our data structure if they are not bothered with unnecessary details of our implementation.
like sentinel nodes
2. We can provide a more robust data structure if we do not permit users to directly access or manipulate the nodes.
3. By better encapsulating the internal details of our implementation, we have greater flexibility to redesign the data structure and 
  improve its performance.

For these reasons, instead of relying directly on nodes, we introduce an independent position abstraction to denote the location of an 
element within a list, and then a complete positional list ADT that can encapsulate a doubly linked list or even an array-based sequence

invalid is if an explicit command is issued to delete it. A position instance is a simple object, supporting only the following method:

p.element()       : Return the element stored at position p
L.first()         : Return the position of the first element of L, or None if L is empty.
L.last()          : Return the position of the last element of L, or None if L is empty.
L.before(p)       : Return the position of L immediately before position p, or None if p is the first position.
L.after(p)        : Return the position of L immediately after position p, or None if p is the last position.
L.is_empty()      : Return True if list L does not contain any elements.
len(L)            : Return the number of elements in the list.
iter(L)           : Return a forward iterator for the elements of the list.
L.add_first(e)    : Insert a new element e at the front of L, returning the position of the new element.
L.add_last(e)     : Insert a new element e at the back of L, returning the position of the new element.
L.add_before(p, e): Insert a new element e just before position p in L, returning the position of the new element.
L.add_after(p, e) : Insert a new element e just after position p in L, returning the position of the new element.
L.replace(p, e)   : Replace the element at position p with element e, returning the element formerly at position p.
L.delete(p)       : Remove and return the element at position p in L, invalidating the position.

Note well that the first( ) and last( ) methods of the positional list ADT return the associated positions,not the elements ike in deque
The advantage of receiving a position as a return value is that we can use that position to navigate the list.
cursor = data.first( )
while cursor is not None:
  print(cursor.element( )) # print the element stored at the position
  cursor = data.after(cursor) # advance to the next position (if any)
