A tree is an abstract data type that stores elements hierarchically. With the exception of the top element, each element in a tree has a 
parent element and zero or more children elements. for tree T parent-child relationship that satisfies the following properties:

• If T is nonempty, it has a special node, called the root of T, that has no parent.
• Each node v of T different from the root has a unique parent node w; every node with parent w is a child of w.

Two nodes that are children of the same parent are siblings.
A node v is external if v has no children. External nodes are also known as leaves.
A node v is internal if it has one or more children.

#Edge: An edge of tree T is a pair of nodes (u,v) such that u is the parent of v, or vice versa.
Path: A path of T is a sequence of nodes such that any two consecutive nodes in the sequence form an edge.
